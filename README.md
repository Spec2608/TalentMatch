## üìå Project Description

**TalentMatch** is a web-based platform that bridges the gap between students and recruiters by simplifying the job and internship discovery and hiring process. Built with a dual-user interface, the platform serves as a matchmaking engine tailored to early-career talent and recruiters looking for fresh, skilled candidates.

The core idea is to reduce the friction in early talent acquisition, streamline the hiring pipeline, and present opportunities and talent in a more accessible, organized, and efficient format.

## 1. üß† Understanding the Problem

### For Students:

* Lack of centralized platforms for early-career opportunities.
* Limited access to curated roles based on skill level or academic progress.
* Inadequate feedback or visibility into the hiring process.

### For Recruiters:

* Difficulty in filtering genuine, skilled applicants from bulk applications.
* Poor candidate engagement and lack of information about applicant strengths.
* Time-consuming communication and shortlisting workflows.

### Assumptions:

* Students prefer platforms with intuitive UI and targeted opportunities.
* Recruiters value automation and quality over quantity in applications.
